        Make the best homemade Italian pizza dough recipe - All you need is 5 simple ingredients for the best traditional pizza with a thin crispy crust!

This super easy pizza dough recipe follows the traditional Neapolitan version, and believe me, it is absolutely incredible.

My Italian dad was a pizzaiolo for more than 30 years, so I grew up eating lots of pizza. Over the years, I managed to learn all his secrets for the perfect pizza and enjoy every single bite of it.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place lukewarm (do not use hot water!) water in a small bowl, sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar on top, mix and let it rest for 5-10 minutes, until the mixture is nice and bubbly.

        </li>
      
        <li>Then pour the mixture into the mixer, add olive oil and slowly incorporate the flour.</li>

        <li>The dough comes together after 5-6 minutes of mixing time.</li>
        <li>Work the ball of dough with your hands on a clean flour-dusted surface until smooth and even.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ball in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film or a damp kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Allow it to rest in a warm place (about 24-27Â°C) for about 2-3 hours until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>After it has rested, divide the dough into 2-3 smaller pieces and form smooth and even balls.</li>
        <li>Then transfer into a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover with a slightly damp kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Allow the balls to rest and raise for an extra 3-4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 250C-280C / 480F- 530F.</li>
        <li>Instead of using a rolling pin, spread each ball of dough with your hands to form a large circle.</li>
        <li>For a classic pizza Margherita, spread just enough marinara sauce (aka pizza sauce) on top, leaving a border. </li>
        <li>Place it in the oven and cook it for about 3 minutes, then add sliced mozzarella (make sure to pat the slices dry with kitchen paper) and cook for a further 1-2 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, scatter a few basil leaves on top and serve.</li>

    </ol>
